# SmartParking - decentralized platform for parking space rental

## Application overview
SmartParking is an innovative mobile and web application that allows private parking space owners to rent out their spaces to users in real-time or in advance. The application leverages smart contracts on the blockchain to automate and secure the management of transactions, reservations, and the collection of penalties in cases of delays or non-compliance with reservations. Our mission is to improve the efficiency of parking space utilization, reduce the stress of finding parking for users, and enable owners to generate additional income.

## Purpose of the application
The application is intended for two main user groups:

1. **Parking space owners:** Individuals who own private parking spaces, whether in a yard, garage, or another private area, and wish to rent them out for additional income.
2. **Users seeking parking:** Individuals looking for available parking spaces during specific time periods, whether for short-term or long-term parking.

## Key features

1. **Registration and management of parking spaces:**
   - Owners can register one or more parking spaces on the platform, set an hourly rate and deposit amount, and manage the availability of their spaces.

2. **Parking space reservation:**
   - Users can search for available parking spaces by location, price, and availability, and reserve a spot for a specific time period. Transactions are secure and automated through smart contracts.

3. **Automated payment and fund distribution:**
   - The smart contract automatically manages transactions, including payment of the reservation, deposit, penalties for delays, and the distribution of funds between the parking space owner and the platform.

4. **Advanced reservation management:**
   - The application allows flexible management of reservations with the option to update the next user coming after the current renter.

5. **Penalties for delays:**
   - If a user does not vacate the parking space on time, the smart contract automatically calculates and charges a penalty, which is then split between the parking space owner and the next user (if applicable).

6. **Transaction fees:**
   - The application earns revenue by taking a small fee (e.g., 5%) from each successful transaction, ensuring a stable income stream for maintaining and further developing the platform.

## How the smart contract works
The smart contract on the blockchain is the core of the application and enables secure and automated interaction between users and parking space owners. Here's how the smart contract operates:

1. **Parking space registration:**
   - The parking space owner registers their space on the platform, setting the hourly rate and deposit amount. This data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

2. **Reservation and payment:**
   - The user reserves a parking space for a specific time period and pays in advance, including the deposit and rental fee. The smart contract ensures that the funds are securely held until the reservation is completed.

3. **Automated penalty collection:**
   - If the user does not vacate the parking space on time, the smart contract automatically calculates a penalty and distributes the funds to the parking space owner and the next user (if any).

4. **Platform fee:**
   - The smart contract automatically takes a percentage of the transaction as a fee and forwards it to the platform owner, ensuring the sustainability of the business model.

## Smart contract capabilities

- **Secure and transparent transactions:** All financial aspects, including payments and penalties, are automatically managed via the blockchain, ensuring user trust.
- **Flexible reservation management:** The ability to update the next user in real-time.
- **Automated penalty calculation and collection:** Ensures that all parties adhere to agreed terms.
- **Revenue distribution:** The smart contract automatically handles the distribution of funds between the parking space owner, the next user, and the platform.

## Problem the application solves

1. **Lack of parking spaces:** In urban areas, finding parking is often difficult, especially near popular destinations. SmartParking enables better utilization of existing private parking spaces, reducing the need for constructing new parking lots.
  
2. **Inefficient use of private parking spaces:** Many owners have parking spaces that are unused during certain parts of the day. The application allows owners to monetize their parking spaces when they are not in use.

3. **Uncertainty and lack of trust in transactions:** Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries and ensure transparency and security in transactions, increasing user trust.

## Expected impact and benefits

- **For users:** Faster and easier parking space discovery, reduced stress and costs associated with parking.
- **For parking space owners:** Additional income from unused parking spaces and simple reservation management.
- **For the community:** Better utilization of existing resources, reduced need for new parking lots, and less traffic congestion.

## Plan for further development

- **Market expansion:** We plan to expand the application to larger urban centers to attract more users and parking space owners.
- **Integration with smart cities:** In the future, we aim to integrate SmartParking with smart city initiatives, enabling better traffic and parking resource management.
- **Adding advanced features:** Developing additional features such as dynamic pricing, integration with IoT devices for parking management, and expansion to commercial users.

## Conclusion
SmartParking provides a comprehensive solution to one of the most common problems in urban areasâ€”lack of parking spaces and inefficient use of existing resources. By combining advanced technologies, blockchain security, and the convenience of a mobile application, SmartParking enables owners and users to optimally utilize parking spaces with minimal effort and maximum security. Our goal is to create a platform that not only facilitates parking but also contributes to the development of smarter and more sustainable cities.
